## Welcome to Cyclemate API

Cyclemate provides **4 public APIs** for bike routing, event discovery, and bike-share availability. These APIs are designed to help developers build cycling-focused applications with rich routing capabilities and real-time bike availability data.

## Base URL

```
https://your-api-domain.com
```

## Authentication

**Auth0 authentication required.** All API requests must include a valid Auth0 bearer token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH0_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### Getting an Auth0 Token

1. Sign up or log in through your Cyclemate app
2. Your app will receive an Auth0 access token
3. Include this token in the `Authorization` header for all API requests

### Token Format

```bash
curl https://api.cyclemate.com/events/nearby/?latitude=40.7589&longitude=-73.9851 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

## Rate Limiting

Please be respectful of our API resources. While we don't enforce strict rate limits on public endpoints, excessive usage may result in temporary throttling.

## Legacy URLs

For backward compatibility, the following legacy URLs are still supported:
- `/mapbox/directions/` → Use `/directions/` instead
- `/mapbox/directions/bikeshare/` → Use `/multi-modal/` instead

- Admin dashboard and management tools
- Internal analytics and tracking
- Search and location services
